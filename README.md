# API-Integration-and-Data-Visualization-

COMPANY:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME:PRACHI DODEJA

INTERNID:CT04DL01

DOMAIN:PYTHON

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH
In this task, interns gained hands-on experience with API integration and data visualization using Python. The primary objective was to fetch real-time data from a public API—such as OpenWeatherMap—and transform this raw data into insightful graphical representations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🔍 Overview of Work Done:
A Python script was developed to connect to a selected public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, CoinGecko, or a population stats API).

The script fetched real-time JSON data, parsed and processed the information, and extracted meaningful insights.

The processed data was visualized using appropriate chart types such as:

Line charts for time-series data (e.g., temperature over the week)

Bar graphs for categorical comparisons (e.g., weather conditions across cities)

Pie charts for proportions (e.g., percentage of different weather types)

Heatmaps for correlation or intensity visualizations

🛠️ Key Deliverables:
✅ A well-documented Python script that performs:

API connection and data retrieval

JSON parsing and data cleaning

Dynamic visualization using Matplotlib/Seaborn

✅ A basic data dashboard that showcases the visualizations:

Implemented as a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

Optionally exported as a static HTML report or embedded in a web page using tools like Plotly Dash or Streamlit

🎯 Skills Demonstrated:
API handling (GET requests, authentication, query parameters)

Data extraction and manipulation using Python (Pandas, JSON)

Data visualization and storytelling through charts

Creating interactive or static dashboards for reporting insights
 Task 2: Automated Report Generation – Successfully Executed
In this task, interns developed a fully functional automated report generation system using Python. The core objective was to read data from a structured file (CSV/Excel), analyze it, and generate a professionally formatted PDF report using libraries like FPDF or ReportLab.

📌 Objectives Completed:
✅ Data Reading: The script efficiently reads data from a local CSV or Excel file using pandas.

✅ Data Analysis: Interns performed statistical summaries, aggregations, and visualizations of the data (e.g., totals, means, categories, trends).

✅ PDF Report Generation: Using fpdf or reportlab, a clean and readable PDF report was generated. The report included:

Titles and headers

Tabulated data summaries

Charts and plots embedded as images (optional but recommended)

Branding and formatting for professionalism

✅ Automation: The entire pipeline was automated—executing all steps from reading the file to generating and saving the final report in PDF format with a single script run.

📦 Final Deliverables:
✅ A well-documented Python script that performs:

File reading and data preprocessing

Analytical summaries

PDF creation and formatting

Optional: Visualization embedding

✅ A sample output PDF report showcasing the results

✅ Optional enhancements:

Emailing the report using smtplib

Scheduling with cron or Task Scheduler

CLI inputs for dynamic file selection

🧠 Skills Demonstrated:
File handling and data parsing using pandas

PDF report generation using fpdf or reportlab

Basic data analytics and formatting

Automation techniques for report creation

This task helped interns gain practical experience in generating automated professional reports, a critical skill for data analysts, Python developers, and business intelligence roles.

AI-Based Chatbot using NLP – Successfully Executed
In this task, interns were challenged to design and implement an AI-powered chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal was to simulate real-world chatbot behavior for domains like customer support, FAQ automation, or simple task management.

📌 Objectives Accomplished:
✅ NLP Integration: Interns used powerful NLP libraries such as NLTK and spaCy to parse, tokenize, and interpret natural language queries.

✅ Tokenization and NER: The chatbot processes user inputs through tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) to extract meaningful context.

✅ Intent Recognition: Basic intent classification logic was added to help the chatbot understand different types of queries and respond accordingly (e.g., greetings, asking for help, task-specific commands).

✅ Response Generation: Context-aware, rule-based or template-based responses were provided for a predefined set of intents and queries.

✅ Handling Small Talk: The chatbot was trained (manually or using simple logic) to respond to small talk like "Hello", "How are you?", and "What can you do?" to enhance the user experience.

🛠️ Implementation Highlights:
Python-based chatbot built using:

NLTK or spaCy for preprocessing and NER

Regex, keyword matching, or intent classification using bag-of-words or TF-IDF

Responses were handled through:

A dictionary of predefined templates

Fallback/default responses for unknown inputs

Optionally extended with:

Speech-to-text/text-to-speech capabilities

Integration into a simple UI or web interface using Tkinter or Flask

📦 Final Deliverables:
✅ A Python script or package implementing the chatbot logic

✅ A demo conversation log or working interface showcasing chatbot interactions

✅ Optional UI or terminal-based interface for user interaction

🧠 Skills Demonstrated:
Understanding and applying NLP concepts: tokenization, NER, POS tagging, intent detection

Rule-based or simple ML-based conversational design

Real-world applications of chatbots in AI-powered assistants, virtual agents, and support systems

This task gave interns a solid foundation in building real-world NLP solutions, bridging theoretical concepts with applied AI, and understanding the architecture behind intelligent conversational agents.


Python Automation – Successfully Executed
This task challenged interns to design and implement scripts that automate routine tasks using Python. The goal was to showcase how programming can be leveraged to eliminate manual work, increase productivity, and streamline workflows across various domains.

📌 Key Automation Areas Covered:
